      his extract recipe provides the basic building blocks of a tasty American
      Pale Ale. The 6-row pale malt provides a nice grainy character and the
      crystal provides some caramel sweetness and smooths out the mouthfeel. The
      hop schedule consists of two of the American classics and is designed to
      balance bitterness, flavor and aroma. This recipe is designed for the new
      home-brewer, and can be made with the most basic equipment setup.

        Tie the American 6-row malt and Crystal 20L malt in a mesh hop-bag. Heat

      </li>
      <li>
        Raise temperature slowly to 170°F. Make sure mesh bag isn`t sitting
        directly on the bottom of the pot. Remove the grain bag and add water to
        make 3 gallons total.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bring the wort to a vigorous boil. As water is heating, slowly add malt
