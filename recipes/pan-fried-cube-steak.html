  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <div style="width: 640px">
    <p style="line-height: 1.4;">
      Cube steak is a cut of meat from either the top round or the bottom round,
      that is run through the store's mechanical tenderizer. It is usually sold
      in individual portions, from 4-ounce up to 8-ounces each. Sometimes the
      cut is called minute steak, perhaps because it takes only minutes to
      prepare. I used to watch my Mom prepare these for dinner, and it's kind of
      a challenge to write down what I've always done without a recipe, but here
      it goes! You may use garlic salt, or your favorite seasoning salt, to
      replace the regular salt and pepper.

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <div style="width: 640px">
    <ul style="line-height: 1.8;">
      <li>24 ounces cube steak, cut into 4 portions</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
      <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>⅓ cup Worcestershire sauce, divided</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2>Steps:</h2>
  <div style="width: 640px">
    <ol style="line-height: 1.8;">
      <li>
        Lightly season both sides of each cube steak with salt and pepper. (See
        Cook's Note).
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 1 Tablespoon unsalted butter in a large, non-stick skillet over
        medium heat. Once butter is foamy, add cube steaks and sprinkle about 2
        teaspoons Worcestershire sauce on top of each cube steak. Cook until
        brown, 3 to 4 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the steaks, and sprinkle each with an additional 1 to 2 teaspoons
        Worcestershire sauce. Cook until steaks are firm and reddish-pink and
        juicy in the center, about 3 minutes more. An instant-read thermometer
        inserted into the center should read 135 degrees F (57 degrees C).
        Remove to a platter and tent with foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make the pan sauce, pour about 1/2 cup water into the skillet and
        stir all the browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Bring to a boil
        and cook for about 2 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Remove from heat and stir in remaining butter, until melted.</li>
      <li>Evenly divide pan sauce over each cube steak and serve warm.</li>
    </ol>
